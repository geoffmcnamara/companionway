Tracking ID and property number
The tracking ID (2) is a string like UA-000000-01. It must be included in your tracking code to tell Analytics which account and property to send data to. It's automatically included in the JavaScript snippet for websites, but also needs to be included in other tracking technologies like the SDKs and the Measurement Protocol, for Analytics to work. The first set of numbers (000000, in the example above) refers to your account number, and the second set (-01) refers to the specific property number (3) associated with the account. The tracking ID is in large font on the Tracking Info page. You can also to see the entire string in the first few lines of the tracking code JavaScript snippet.
