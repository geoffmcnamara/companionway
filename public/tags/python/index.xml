      <description>Python all() function Much of my coding efforts are directed towards analyzing financial data specifically targeting potential cash secured puts or covered calls. Recently, I had to refine some market overview displays. I needed a listing of the current market &amp;ldquo;gainers&amp;rdquo; and market &amp;ldquo;losers&amp;rdquo;. There is one site which I scrape using panda read_html function to grab a hadful of tables. My problem arises from two factors. One is there are no labels or titles to the tables and they can vary.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pdb is a great debugger for python but I like to use my own simple debug functions.
Here is a simple debug function for python which could definitely be improved:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sometimes It Is The Obvious</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was one of those &amp;ldquo;problems&amp;rdquo; that nagged me for many hours until the obvious dawned on me.
I wrote a python script to grab the temperature and humidity from a DHT22 sensor and then write the
output with the proper syntax to send to my monitoring program [xymon]. The wrapper bash script ran
every 5 minutes and used a redirection to write out a file ie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/temphum.sh &amp;gt;/tmp/temphum.dat
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wrapper script grabs output and sends it to the server. Having this wrapper script lets me run the
python script independently for testing or for curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
