      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our last post discussed using fisa-vimrc and appreciating the simple installation and ease of use. This post will explore, briefly, some tweaks and a short &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; for each of the loaded plugins. This exercise will be worth your time if you have not explored these tools before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not be concerned about finishing this post in one sitting. Take a section at a time and play with it. Move on when you are ready. A lot of information is here but that is because you have lot available to you under the hood. The sections below minimumly scratch the surface. Go play with each plug-in to at least find out what features it offers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VIM is a standard for me. My UNIX career hung on my &amp;ldquo;vi&amp;rdquo; savvy which I learned appreciate from mentors who
encouraged me to learn the tips and tricks of using vi. My learning curve with vi/vim has never leveled
off, but rather, always gives me new features and tricks that energize me again. The latest vim &amp;ldquo;trick&amp;rdquo;
is ALE (Asynchronous Lint Engine).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vim Scriptable Templates</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;dynamic-vim-templates&#34;&gt;Dynamic vim Templates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim (or vi in the anceint past) has been my partner in getting things done. Like an rich tool it
has lots of features that go untapped or undiscovered. A few days ago I decided I wanted a script within
a tempate to help build the &amp;ldquo;front matter&amp;rdquo; to my markdown (.md) files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front matter looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+++
author = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
comments = true
date = &amp;quot;2018-07-15 14:45:19&amp;quot;
draft = false
image = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
share = true
# slug = 
# tags = [ &amp;quot;tag1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tag2&amp;quot; ]
title = &amp;quot;vim_scriptable_templates&amp;quot;

+++
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge was to have vim write in the date for me in the needed format. And if you use hugo as your static web site generator as I do
you may have found that it will silently ignore a new markdown file if the date is not formated correctly. It some testing to discover that
but the bottom line is that I needed a way to script it for to avoid mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research to me to this tip source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Use_eval_to_create_dynamic_templates&#34;&gt; vim embedded scripts &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
