      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our last post discussed using fisa-vimrc and appreciating the simple installation and ease of use. This post will explore, briefly, some tweaks and a short &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; for each of the loaded plugins. This exercise will be worth your time if you have not explored these tools before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not be concerned about finishing this post in one sitting. Take a section at a time and play with it. Move on when you are ready. A lot of information is here but that is because you have lot available to you under the hood. The sections below minimumly scratch the surface. Go play with each plug-in to at least find out what features it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
