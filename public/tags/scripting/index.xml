      <title>Sometimes It Is The Obvious</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was one of those &amp;ldquo;problems&amp;rdquo; that nagged me for many hours until the obvious dawned on me.
I wrote a python script to grab the temperature and humidiy from a DHT22 sensor and then write the
output with the proper syntax to send to my monitoring program [xymon]. The wrapper bash script ran
every 5 minutes and used a redirection to write out a file ie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/temphum.sh &amp;gt;/tmp/temphum.dat
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wrapper script grabs output and sends it to the server. Having this wrapper script lets me run the
python script independantly for testing or for curiousity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>To make a long story short&amp;hellip;
#!/bin/bash PATTERN=$(echo $1 | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]) # or PATTERN=$(echo $1 | tr [a-z] [A-Z]) # or PATTERN=$(echo $1 | awk &#39;{print toupper($0)}&#39;) echo &amp;quot;Your \$1 argument is now uppercase: $1&amp;quot;  To make a short story long&amp;hellip;
Just to let you know a little more about me and reveal a few more shells tricks along the way.
 I am a very conservative investor - always have been but the low interest rates over the recent past has forced me to try a squeeze a little more out of the stock market also known as a &amp;ldquo;a gentleman&amp;rsquo;s gambling parlor of greedy people&amp;rdquo;.</description>
