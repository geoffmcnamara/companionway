# Center a string using awk 
## awk = everyone's favorite - right?

People who know me also know that I prefer simple
universally available tools to get a job done. Awk is
probably one of my favorites because it does pretty 
much anything I need for quick and simple jobs. It is 
far more powerful than most people realize including
associative arrays and it will do anything grep and sed  
can do.


Recently I had the need to center a string of text. This
is a easy problem that pretty much any freshman programmer
can accomplish in a heartbeat but I decided to do it with
awk. This sample gives you a chance to explore rudimentary
features of awk.

<!--more--> 
Assumptions:

- STRING = "my string for centering"
- LLEN = 65 # This is the line length

```
echo $STRING | awk -vllen=$LLEN '
  BEGIN{for(i=1;i<=llen;i++){printf i%10};printf "\n"}
  {
  startpos = (llen - length)/2;
  for(i=1;i<=startpos;i++)
  {
    printf " "
  }
  print $0
  }' 
```

The BEGIN section is just to provide a rule line

"length" is the length of the line fed into awk ($0 variable).
"startpos" is the start position for the string - the for   
loop just prints a space until startpos is reached (printf   
 is used to avoid a line break).

Not perfect but it works for me.
