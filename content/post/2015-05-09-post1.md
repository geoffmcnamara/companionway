# Check out GrovePi

These kits make working with the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins
so simple and clean.  I just ordered one of these kits and
I will try to write up a review after I work it over.

If you are interested in building a quick and easy raspberry pi 
for experimenting with the "Internet of Things" (aka IoT) platform - this board and kit
looks like it will get you there in minutes. Approx: $89 - 
includes board, and *lots* of sensors/accessories with wires 
and connectors.
