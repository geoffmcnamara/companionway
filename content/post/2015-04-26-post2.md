# Wifi mt7630e 

Today's hero is Jakub Kicinski. He rewrote the Mediatek MT7630e drivers
to clean up the code *and* work with the new kernels. I have been waiting
for someone to do this since they (ubuntu) moved forward from kernel 3.13.xxxx.

Kudo's to Mr. Kicinski!

Here is the link:
[github kuba-moo/mt7630e] (https://github.com/kuba-moo/mt7630e.git)

<!--more-->

Do a git clone of his code and then...
Build as he spells out (simple steps) in his README.md file.

Enjoy
