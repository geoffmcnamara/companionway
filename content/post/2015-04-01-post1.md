# Markdown - this heading uses Setext style
You can    
break lines  
by adding >=2 spaces  
to the end 
before starting the next line

This heading uses atx style
=============================

<p>I am learning that you have to name     
 your post file with YYYY-MM-DD-whatever.markdown

or

the **extension** _can_ be ".md"
<p>


>quoted text
>here

<!--more-->

A list:

* one
* two
* three

To get \\(LaTex\\) to work I had to add this to the \_includes/footer.html
You can actually add it right into the markdown file itself. I put it
in the footer because it is a bit more efficient to have the js loaded last.


```javascript
<script type="text/javascript"
    src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">
</script>
```
and change the _config to use redcarpet for markdown

BTW - to get \\(Latex\\) in the same line use:
```
insert \\(LaTex\\) here
```

Now this code  

```
$$a^2 + b_i^2 = c^2 \left(\frac12\right) $$
```
looks like this:
$$a^2 + b_i^2 = c^2 \left(\frac12\right)$$
or block \\(Latex\\):
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}}\\]

Here is some ruby code:

```ruby
ruby -run -e httpd . -p 9090 # which serves up the current directory
```
{% highlight ruby linenos%}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

Inline code `echo DEBUG: $LINENO`

A table ( arrrg [^n]):

lets | do   |a     |table |
:---- |:----:| ----:| ----:|
with | more | rows | here |


<table border=2>
 <tr>
  <td>one</td><td>two</td>
 </tr>
</table>
