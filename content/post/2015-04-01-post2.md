# This website 
... was created (and is maintained) using jekyll.

But getting here was a bit of a struggle.  
I started using Jekyll quite some time ago. I love ruby and when I  
found Jekyll I thought my mutual love for ruby and website design 
had perfectly come together.

Not so fast there buckeroo. I could not easily manage themes in a way  
that satisfied me... so I went exploring. I tried dozens of flat CMS  
generators. My journey lasted months. I was very impressed with gravCMS  
but I still fought with theme manipulation.

Sinatra and nanco were inspiring but somewhere I came across a blog  
which I don't recall now, that had me building my own theme. That  
gave me enought traction to begin to understand how to control themes.

What brought me back to jekyll was github. I have been building out  
my github site and it is built with jekyll. It is hard to fight success  
and obviously jekyll has had a strong history of success with github. Then  
I pounded a handful of themes available and recently found myself working  
more and more with the startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll.


More to come...
