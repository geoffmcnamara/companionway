<p class="introduction">I am a native of Northern Virginia, grew up there, and worked most of my life there. I had all advantages that come with the area including a good school system and a relatively resilient economy.</p>

I attend George Mason University and eventually found my way into  the Fairfax County Fire Department. I had a wonderful 25 year career with the Fire Service and  built strong friendships with many good people. I had the opportunity to serve in many  capacities while with the Fire Department. I continued attending college  and studying a variety of subjects, one of which turned out to be  my second career and passion - computers.

This journey of passion led me to become a UNIX system administrator and to my good fortune  I worked for several great mentors. I worked with Blair Miller several times  after my initial employment with him where he gave my my first chance  to learn the skills to be a productive system administrator and taught me  invaluable lessons in all areas related to the IT world.

Many projects later, having worked with other great people, I had a healthy set  of skills that allowed me to work with large corporations where I was challenged with large build outs designed to handle huge web volumes of dynamic delivery content.

Teaching and coaching have always played a role in my career.   There is a reward for me in developing the knowledge base and skills of others that  provides me with a productive sense of satisfaction.

I now enjoy learning new skills everyday and look forward to continuing to teach  and coach others along the way.
