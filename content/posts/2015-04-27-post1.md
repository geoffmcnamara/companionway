# Command line disk tree

I am writing another article on the basics of using git. It
was going to be a short article however, given the subject it is
turning out to be much longer than I expected. But in the process
of writing it I had to frequently use a shell function I wrote years 
ago that  displays a disk tree structure (optionally with files).

I needed a way to see the changes to the .git directory as git commands
are executed against the repository. I thought I would share it
with you today.

Here is a sample of its output:

```
$ dt -f

    Note: use "dt -f" to add files to the tree listing
Enjoy!
```

Here is the code writen as a function (which is in my ~/.bashrc script).

```
###########################################################
dt () # Print a crude dir-tree
###########################################################
{
  LINE="============================================"
  TYPE="-type d";
  if [ "${1}" = "-f" ]; then
    shift;
    TYPE="";
    ( cd ${1-"."} );
  else
    if [ "${2}" = "-f" ]; then
      TYPE="";
      ( cd ${1-"."} );
    fi;
  fi;
  echo "${LINE}";
  echo "             `hostname` : `pwd`/${1-.}  ";
  echo " Run Date: `date` ";
  echo "${LINE}";
  find ${1-.} $TYPE -print 2> /dev/null | sort -f | sed -e "s,^${1-.},," -e "/^$/d" -e "s,[^/]*/\([^/]*\)$,\+-----\1," -e "s,[^/]*/,|     ,g";
  echo "${LINE}";
  echo "    Note: use \"dt -f\" to add files to the tree listing";
  echo "Enjoy!"
}
```

Have a nice day!
