HarvardX - free classes (if you audit them)

These are awesome online classes. The first one that caught me was [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) which is a tremendous in depth overview of Computer Science --- really a very impressive class even if you are an old salt.

Today I got an email about a new series of classes they are offering. The Shakespeare classes have pulled me in but I would love to take them all.

If you have time, these are worth it.
