The stoics of ancient Greece had an impact on many aspects of our lives. It influenced everything for Christian thought to contemporary self-help books. Today's stoic thought revolves around "Amor Fati", loosely defined as loving fate. This single philosophic perspective, practiced well, can change your heart and your life.

Apostle Paul said in his letter to the Philippians 4:12: NIV 	
>>I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.

Epictetus said: 
>>Do not seek to have events happen as you want them but instead want them to happen and your life will go well.

Learn to live with a grateful heart and your reaction to challenges will change. Burdens will become course adjustments.

I have to add a personal opinion here. The stoic philosophy offers simple and effective perspectives for successfully navigating life but it falls short of being the final solution to finding a happy existence.
