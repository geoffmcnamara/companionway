# Musings amid Chaos

### Stoicism: 
- Being good, associating with good, and rationally accepting what is, reduces risk of peril and sets the stage for contentment.

### Christian:
- Life is a series of structured chance encounters, each designed to speak to you.

### Sonnet LIII
<i>
What is your substance, whereof are you made,<br>
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?<br>
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,<br>
And you but one, can every shadow lend.<br>
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit<br>
Is poorly imitated after you;<br>
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,<br>
And you in Grecian tires are painted new: <br>
Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,<br>
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,<br>
The other as your bounty doth appear;<br>
And you in every blessed shape we know.<br>
   In all external grace you have some part,<br>
   But you like none, none you, for constant heart.<br> </i>
Shakespeare
