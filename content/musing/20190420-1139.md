Artists who can paint bring light into my world. I have watched the "Mural Joe" series on YouTube for a few years now. I came across another one today and it reminded me of how good he is at explaining colors, light, and perspective. He does murals (or at least that is how his series started) but his principalsare transferable to anything style of paining. One of the first videos I watched depicted his work on a childrens room in a hospital with a pirate scene.  [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq0o6PNrHwo)

The video I came across today was far more subdued that some of his other works but still offers valuable tips: [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o_Z5jt4qNU)

Enjoy
