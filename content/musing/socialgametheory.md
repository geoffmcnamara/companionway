This is a very interesting game dealing with social trust, benfits of cooperation, damge of miscommunication, cheating etc. 

This helps us to understand why in the middle of WWI soldiers from both side stopped fighting on Christmas day...

Try this game. If you are like me, you will get sucked in just to find out what the final conclusions are... only takes a few minutes of your valuable time:
