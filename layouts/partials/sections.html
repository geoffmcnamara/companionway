<!-- SECTIONS
 Build out any content/section/files.md - gwm addition - uses weight to determine order
   This is ugly but it works - it means you have to write all the html code in the file.md
   because there is no template
   I want to add contact/location info... etc here?

<section>
{{ range where .Data.Pages.ByWeight "Section" "section"}}
    {{ if not .Params.draft }}
      {{ .Content }}
    {{ end }}
{{end}}
